# Project: Identify Customer Segments



# Install:

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- <a href = https://numpy.org/> NumPy</a>
- <a href = https://pandas.pydata.org/> Pandas</a>
- <a href = https://matplotlib.org/> matplotlib</a> 
- <a href =https://scikit-learn.org/stable/> scikit-learn</a>


 You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an <a href = http://ipython.org/notebook.html> iPython Notebook</a>
 

We recommend students install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.


# Project Overview:
In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

This notebook will help you complete this task by providing a framework within which you will perform your analysis steps. In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks. The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.

It should be noted that while there will be precise guidelines on how you should handle certain tasks in the project, there will also be places where an exact specification is not provided. There will be times in the project where you will need to make and justify your own decisions on how to treat the data. These are places where there may not be only one way to handle the data. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.

At the end of most sections, there will be a Markdown cell labeled Discussion. In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.
