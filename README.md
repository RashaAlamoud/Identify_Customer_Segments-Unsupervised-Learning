# Project: Identify Customer Segments



# Install:

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- <a href = https://numpy.org/> NumPy</a>
- <a href = https://pandas.pydata.org/> Pandas</a>
- <a href = https://matplotlib.org/> matplotlib</a> 
- <a href =https://scikit-learn.org/stable/> scikit-learn</a>


 You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an <a href = http://ipython.org/notebook.html> iPython Notebook</a>
 

We recommend students install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.


# Project Overview:
In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
